# Book Recommendation System 

## Overview
This project is a content-based book recommendation system built using FAISS for vector search and Ollama's nomic-embed-text model for generating semantic embeddings. The goal is to recommend similar books based on a given book.
Ollama is used to generate text embeddings for each book, I selected this embedding model because it is lightweight and optimized for efficiency, making it ideal for running on my laptopâ€™s hardware. Unlike larger models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings) that requires payments and high-end GPUs.

## Tools Used
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
- Ollama(nomic-embed-text) for text embedding generation
- FAISS for similarity search using vector embeddings
- Jupyter Notebook as the development environment

## Dataset
The dataset [7K Books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata) was obtained from kaggle. It contains 7,000 books with metadata such as:
- Title, Authors, Description (summary/blurb)
- Categories (genres/subjects)
- Published Year, Average Rating, Number of Pages
- Additional fields like publisher, language, etc.

## Results
The final output provides a list of book recommendations based on the most semantically similar content, offering personalized and meaningful suggestions to the user.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate a frontend interface using Streamlit or Flask.
- Expand the embedding model with multilingual or larger models (e.g., mxbai-embed-large).
