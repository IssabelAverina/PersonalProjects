# Book Recommendation System with Ollama 

## Overview
This project is a content-based book recommendation system built using FAISS for vector search and Ollama's nomic-embed-text model for generating semantic embeddings. The goal is to recommend similar books based on the textual metadata (title, author, description, etc.) of a given book.
Ollama is used to generate text embeddings for each book, I selected this embedding model because it is lightweight and optimized for efficiency, making it ideal for running on my laptopâ€™s hardware. Unlike larger models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings) that requires payments and high-end GPUs.

## Tools Used
- Pandas/Numpy for data manipulation
- Ollama(nomic-embed-text) for text embedding generation
- FAISS for similarity search using vector embeddings
- Jupyter Notebook as the development environment
